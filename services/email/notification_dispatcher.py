"""
Subscription state-change → branded email dispatcher.

This is the single email side-effect path. It is attached to the existing
`after_subscription_mutation` hook (services/vip_membership.py), which already
runs after every subscription state transition (webhooks, admin tools, and the
periodic lapse sweep). It does NOT touch subscription/state-machine logic.

Guarantees (per spec):
  - NEVER blocks the caller — the actual IO runs in a daemon thread.
  - NEVER raises to the caller — every error is logged internally.
  - Idempotent — a given (user, resulting-state, snapshot) emails at most once,
    enforced by a DB unique key (database.models_email_idempotency).

State → email mapping:
  ACTIVE    → Payment Successful / Access Activated
  PAST_DUE  → Payment Failed / Action Required
  CANCELLED → Subscription Cancelled
  EXPIRED   → Subscription Expired
Other states (INACTIVE, GRACE, PENDING_PAYMENT, SUSPENDED) produce no email.
