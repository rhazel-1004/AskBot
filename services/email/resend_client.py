"""Thin Resend send wrapper.

The only place that talks to the Resend SDK. Designed so the rest of the app
never has to think about whether email is configured or installed:

  - `resend` is imported lazily; if the package is absent the layer disables
    itself (logs + skips) instead of crashing the process at import time.
  - send_email never raises — it returns True/False and logs the outcome.
